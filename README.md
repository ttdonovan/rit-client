rit-client
==========

rit-client is a gem for consuming Rit content within a Rails application. (A goal is to make this gem framework independent, should work with Rails, Sinatra or whatever).
The creation of this gem was inspired from Brian Doll's [rit\_client](http://github.com/briandoll/rit_client), a Rails plugin.

Please see [Rit. content scheduling system](http://github.com/briandoll/Rit/). and [Rit documentation and wiki](http://github.com/briandoll/Rit/) for more information on Rit.

Development and Installation
============================

  * rake -T (see list of jeweler tasks)
  * rake install
  * require gem in your application (hmm... if require doesn't work try gem unpack in vendor/gems)
